# Open Panzer Package Lists for the Arduino Board Manager

This branch contains the Arduino IDE Boards Manager installation support files. You probably don't need to download any of these. If you want to install an Open Panzer board in the Arduino IDE, [go to the master branch of this repo](https://github.com/OpenPanzerProject/OpenPanzerBoards/tree/master) and read the instructions there. 

For a discussion of how we created our packages, see this informative thread on the Arduino forums:
