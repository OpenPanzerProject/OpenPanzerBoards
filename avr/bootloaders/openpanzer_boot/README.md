## What Is In This Folder? 

This folder contains the custom bootloader used on the TCB - both a precompiled hex, and the source code. The bootloader is a small piece of code that remains on the TCB and allows the main program (firmware) to be rewritten easily using OP Config or the Arduino IDE without any special equipment other than USB cable. 

## Do I Need to Do Anything With This? 

Probably not, the bootloader should already come installed on your TCB from the factory. But if you are a developer, are curious, or for some reason need to re-write the bootloader on your device, read on. 

## Bootloader Details

This bootloader is a modification of the standard Arduino stk500boot bootloader used for the Mega boards. It was first modified by [Arduino Forum user Krupski](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=309467.0) who removed the bulky and largely-unused Monitor utility and reduced the overall size of the bootloader to roughly 2kB. 

The Open Panzer project subsequently modified it further for our own purposes. The primary change is the ability to select which serial port you want to flash the chip when writing new firmware. This is done by the position of Dipswitch #5 on the TCB. 

When Dipswitch #5 is in the On position, the bootloader will listen on Serial 0, which is the onboard USB port on the TCB. 

When Dipswitch #5 is in the Off position the bootloader will listen on Serial 1, which is broken out as a six-pin header on the TCB. This header is fully compatible with typical FTDI adapters or cables, or most conveniently of all, the [Adafruit Bluefruit EZ-Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1588). This allows wireless flashing of the firmware on the TCB. 

**Note 1:** If you are having problems flashing new firmware to your board, make sure you have Dipswitch #5 set in the correct position! 

**Note 2:** If you have the Adafruit bluetooth device, or some other FTDI device plugged into the Serial 1 connector, and you try to re-flash the board over USB, you may still find it doesn't work even if you have Dipswitch #5 in the correct position (On for USB). This is because these other devices can prevent the board from responding to the reset command sent over the USB port. If you manually hold the RESET button on the TCB, start the firmware update, then release the RESET button, it should work. Alternatively, unplug the device from Serial 1, or if you don't want to do that -  just set Dipswitch #5 to the off position and flash over Serial 1!

## Re-Compiling the Bootloader

To re-compile the bootloader you will need avr-gcc. A version previously came bundled with the Arduino IDE but does no longer. If you are developing in Windows, download the latest version of [WinAVR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/) and make sure it creates the correct System Environment path variables when you install it. 

Then open a command prompt at the folder where you have saved these bootloader files. Type the following two commands: 
```
prompt> make clean
prompt> make optcb2560
```

The first command will clear the old hex, the second command will compile a new one. 


## Re-Flashing the Bootloader
To flash the bootloader to your chip you will need a special programmer device. The USBasp is a good one and available for only a few bucks all over eBay. The special programmer will come with a dual-row, six pin plug. The TCB has a matching six-pin header footprint that is not populated from the factory, you will have to solder headers to it or use something like the [SparkFun ISP Pogo Adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11591). 

Plug your programmer into a USB port on your computer. Plug the ISP cable into the TCB. The programmer will not supply power to the TCB so you will also need to connect a battery. 

You can then flash the bootloader using one of two methods: 

### 1. Using the Arduino IDE
Make sure the bootloader hex file is in the `openpanzer_boot` directory of the Arduino bootloaders folder, something like: `C:\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\bootloaders\openpanzer_boot\optcb2560_boot.hex`. 

Also make sure you have updated the Arduino `boards.txt` file to add information for the TCB board ([see the README for the TCB repo](https://github.com/OpenPanzerProject/TCB) for a description). Then in the Arduino IDE, go to the Tools menu, select "Open Panzer TCB (Mega 2560)" as the board, select the appropriate programmer from the Programmer list, then click "Burn Bootloader." 
(Note: recent versions of the IDE seem to be having an issue programming with the AVR ISP Mk1 programer, if you happen to be using one of those. Best to get a USBasp.)

### 2. Using AVRDUDE from the Command Line
Avrdude is the program Arduino uses to write to ATmega chips, but you can use it directly from the command line as well. 

Open a command prompt and browse to the following folder in the Arduino installation directory, where `avrdude.exe` should reside:
`Arduino_Dir\hardware\tools\avr\bin\`

Then run the following commands. This first one 1) erases the existing program memory, 2) unlocks the bootloader section so we can access it in step two, and 3) it sets the three fuse bits to the correct values:

`avrdude -C "YourDrive:\YourArduino_Dir\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf" -p atmega2560 -c usbasp -P usb -v -e -U lock:w:0x3F:m -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -U hfuse:w:0xDA:m -U lfuse:w:0xF7:m`

Note that we are referencing `avrdude.conf` which is a configuration file avrdude needs to know about, and should already exist in your Arduino install directory as shown in the command above. Also if you are using a programmer other than the USBasp you will need to change the `-c` flag, for a list of supported avrdude programmers see [this link](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html) or type `avrdude -c ?` 

Now to flash the bootloader, run this command:

`avrdude -C "YourDrive:\YourArduino_Dir\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf" -p atmega2560 -c usbasp -P usb -v -U flash:w:YourDrive:\PathToBootloader\optcb2560_boot.hex:i -U lock:w:0x0F:m`

Where again you need to specify the actual path to the conf file, your specific programmer, and the actual path to the `optcb2560_boot.hex` file. 

#### Tips
Avrdude doesn't like spaces in file names and for sure will croak if there is a parentheses in the path, such as there will be if you install Arduino on a 64-bit Windows OS (ie, "C:\Program Files (x86)\etc..")

So save yourself some hassle and install Arduino into a clean folder like "C:\Arduino\"

If you are going to be doing a lot of flashing it can be useful to put these commands into a Windows batch file. A sample one is included in this folder. You will first need to edit it in a text editor such as Notepad (but we like [Programmer's Notepad](http://www.pnotepad.org/) better!), and set the paths to the actual ones you will be using. Then you can simply double-click the batch file in Windows and it will execute.
